# Include

 * Write docs on how to get the project running
 * Write docs on how to connect to the server
* test your code
  * ensure that all of your methods have test coverage
  * write tests which start your server, send and receive, and confirm functionality

## Directions
* Create a TCP Server use using the net module
* Create a Client Constructor
* When sockets connect to the server a new `Client` instance should be made
* Clients should have a unique `id` from `node-uuid`
 * **e.g.** `2309-4802-3948-...`
* Clients should have a unique 'nickname'
 * **e.g.** `guest-43`
* When sockets are connected with the ClientPool they should be given event listeners for `data`, `error`, and `close` events
 * When a socket emits the `close` event the socket should be removed from the client pool!
 * When a socket emits the `error` event the error should be logged on the server
 * When a socket emits the `data` event the data should be logged on the server and the `\wack` commands below should be implemented

# Wack commands `'\'`
* `\all` should trigger a broadcast event
* `\nick` should allow a user change their nickname
* `\dm` should allow a user to send a message directly to another user by nick name
* when a user speaks their nickname should be printed
 * **i.e.** `teapot: Sup Hacker?`

## Bonus
* 2pts Write a test that tests `\nick` actually changes a clients nickname
